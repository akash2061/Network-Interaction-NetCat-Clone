+ Listen for incoming connections on a specified port
+ Simple and intuitive command-line interface
+ Written in Rust for reliability and performance

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/akash2061/RustSocket-NetCat-Clone.git
    ```
    ```bash
    cd RustSocket-NetCat-Clone
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    cargo run --release
    ```

### Or Use Released Version

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/akash2061/RustSocket-NetCat-Clone/releases) page or Directly [Download](https://github.com/akash2061/RustSocket-NetCat-Clone/releases/download/v0.2.0/rustsocket) the latest version.
2. Download the latest release for your platform.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the folder where the executable is downloaded.
4. Copy the executable to the `/usr/local/bin` directory using the following command:

    ```bash
    sudo cp ./rustsocket /usr/local/bin/
    ```


Now you can check hash and password from any terminal window by simply typing its name `rustsocket`, thanks to its location in `/usr/local/bin`.
